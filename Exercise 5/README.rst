Exercise 5
##########

Your task is to match this output (note! the horizontal line is drawn by GitHub as part of the header. You do not need to explicitly draw it):

.. image:: Match_This_Output.png

Tip
***

To scale an image, you can add a ``:width:`` or ``:height:`` directive to cap
the width or height of an image to a certain number of pixels.
